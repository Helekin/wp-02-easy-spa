## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html) - A web server solution stack package.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local XAMPP's htdocs folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Helekin/wp-02-easy-spa.git
```

2. **Database Setup**

   - Open phpMyAdmin from XAMPP by navigating to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your web browser.
   
   - Log in using your phpMyAdmin credentials (usually, the default username is 'root' and the password is empty).

   - In the phpMyAdmin interface, click on the "Databases" tab.

   - Create a new database named `easy-spa`.

   - Now, select the newly created `easy-spa` database from the left-hand sidebar.

   - Click on the "Import" tab in the top menu.

   - To import data into the `easy-spa` database, click on the "Choose File" button and select the `easy-spa.sql` file from your project's directory.

   - Ensure the SQL file you're importing contains the necessary database schema and data.

   - Finally, click the "Go" or "Import" button to import the SQL file into the `easy-spa` database.

   - Wait for the import process to complete; you'll see a success message when it's done.


3. After cloning the repository, open your preferred web browser, and in the address bar, enter the following URL:

```sh
http://localhost/wp-01-easy-spa/
```
4. This will take you to the locally hosted WordPress website associated with the project.

5. **Access the WordPress Dashboard**

   To log in and access the WordPress dashboard, use the following credentials:

   - **Username:** `admin`
   - **Password:** `b%M10alCQ0(rlWf!es`
